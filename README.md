# EBI-with-ATxmega128A1U
 connect your microcontroller to the external SRAM chip located on the OOTB Memory Base. Write an assembly program to 
test this interface. Write another assembly program to measure both a complete EBI write cycle and a complete EBI read cycle for 
the SRAM component. Take at most two screenshots to capture the relevant measurements. Annotate the screenshot(s), meaningfully 
describing every change in signal or bus.
